# Elastic observability for Kubernetes

These labs guide you through the Elastic Observability functionality. A sample application is installed on a Kubernetes cluster and connected to an Elastic Observability deployment. The set-up is then used to go through the most important parts of the Elastic Observability product.

Labs:

- Lab 0: Elastic Observability trial instance
- Lab 1: Installation sample application
- Lab 2: Log files
- Lab 3: Metrics
- Lab 4: Application Performance monitoring


## Pre-requisites

For these labs, it is assumed that you have a Kubernetes cluster at your disposal. The labs have been tested on a Minikube cluster, running on Ubuntu.

The pre-requisites are described in more detail in Lab 0 and Lab 1.
